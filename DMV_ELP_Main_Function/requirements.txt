# Release Notes and Development Platform:
# The source code was developed on the Google Cloud platform using Google Cloud Functions serverless computing architecture. The Cloud
# Functions gen 2 version automatically deploys the cloud function on Google Cloud Run as a service under the same name as the Cloud
# Functions. The initial version of this code was created to quickly demonstrate the role of MLOps in the ELP process and to create an MVP. Later,
# this code will be optimized, and Python OOP concepts will be introduced to increase the code reusability and efficiency.
