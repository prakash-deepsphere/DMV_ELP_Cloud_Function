Release Notes and Development Platform:
The source code was developed on the Google Cloud platform using Google Cloud Functions serverless computing architecture. The Cloud
Functions gen 2 version automatically deploys the cloud function on Google Cloud Run as a service under the same name as the Cloud
Functions. The initial version of this code was created to quickly demonstrate the role of MLOps in the ELP process and to create an MVP. Later,
this code will be optimized, and Python OOP concepts will be introduced to increase the code reusability and efficiency.
